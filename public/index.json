The fixed kite type has better aerodynamics, and a longer lifetime. The fixed kite has a higher potential, but also comes with lger risks.\nFly-gen versus Gound-gen\rThe fly-gen kite generates the energy in the air with propellers. Theoretically, it has a higher efficiency, but it is also riskier because the expensive equipment is flying around in the air. There are some promising startups that failed because they ran out of money too quickly when testing their kite. The ground-gen kite is safer as the expensive equipment is on the ground. It produces energy when the kite pulls a wire that makes a turbine spin around. The ground-gen losses though 20% of the produced energy, when it pulls back the kite before it can create energy again.\nFly-gen\rTurbine placement\rAccording to a study by Filippo Trevisi, Gianni Cassoni, Mac Gaunaa, and Lorenzo Fagiano (2025), it is most efficient to place turbines on the wing tips and rotate them inboard down.
