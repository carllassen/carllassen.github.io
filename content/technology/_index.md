# Main Architecture

## Rigid versus Flexible
The flexible kite type is cheaper to produce and can survive crashes, but it has lower 
aerodynamics. The fixed kite type has better aerodynamics, and a longer 
lifetime. The fixed kite has a higher potential, but also comes with lger risks.

## Fly-gen versus Gound-gen
The fly-gen kite generates the energy in the air with propellers. 
Theoretically, it has a higher efficiency, but it is also riskier because the 
expensive equipment is flying around in the air. There are some 
promising startups that failed because they ran out of money too quickly 
when testing their kite. The ground-gen kite is safer as the expensive 
equipment is on the ground. It produces energy when the kite pulls a wire 
that makes a turbine spin around. The ground-gen losses though 20% of 
the produced energy, when it pulls back the kite before it can create 
energy again.

## Turbine placement

According to a study by Filippo Trevisi, Gianni Cassoni, Mac Gaunaa, and Lorenzo Fagiano (2025), it is most efficient to **place turbines on the wing tips** and **rotate them inboard down.** There are though many aspects that should be considered.
