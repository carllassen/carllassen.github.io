# We develop green 10x technologies

#### With a mission to disrupt the fossil fuel industry, we aim to make technologies that are 10x more efficient.
##
#### Airborne Wind Energy has that potential.
##
#### It is a completely new technology and lots of experimentation is needed to make it work.
##
#### If you playful spirit and are ready to fight climate change, please join us!

# Why we need green 10x technologies

#### In 1896, Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius discovered global warming. 130 years later, the climate crisis is common knowledge. Yet, the carben emissions are still rising to new records.
##
#### Even rich modern democracies and modern technologies are still inadequate to reach net zero. We need new strategies and the clock is ticking...
##
#### We need to make big bets. Not because we love gambling, but because its riskier not to. Status quo is not an option. We need 10x improvements!
##
#### We don't know which technologies will save the world, but we believe that Airborne Wind Energy has the potential change the world to the better! 
##
#### No matter which green tech you believe in, we encourage you to develop radical 10x technologies!

Cutted, bended and glued an old election poster into the first prototype. It was unstable and without electronics. It would probably help to move the center of gravity forward.
